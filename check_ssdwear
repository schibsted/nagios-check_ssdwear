=head1 NAME

check_ssdwear - Check all SSD disks in the system for wear left.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

check_ssdwear [options]

  -h           Help - this text.
  -w <months>  Warn if there are less than months left of wear.
               Default is 18 months.  If the disk contains the
               root file system the plugin will report CRITICAL
               instead.
  -c <months>  Critical if there are less than months left of wear.
               Default is 9 months.
  -p <percent> Warning if there is percent% or less left of wear. No
               default but if a non-zero threshold is supplied by
               smartctl this will be used unless this option is specified.
  -q <percent> Critical if there is percent% or less left of wear
               No default.
  -n OK|WARNING|CRITICAL|UNKNOWN
               State to report if there are no SSDs in the system
  -u OK|WARNING|CRITICAL|UNKNOWN
               State to report if there is a unsupported SSD in the system
               This MUST be fixed by updating the plugin as the plugin
               exits immediately if this is discovered, and no monitoring
               will take place.
  -h           This message

NOTE! The program uses sudo to run smartctl, so your nagios/nrpe user
needs sudo for this.

NOTE! Do not use this in an alarm that wakes people up at night.  Disk
weardown is NOT that acute! Or is it?

NOTE! Use this plugin in combination with SMART plugin that monitors
other health parameters of the disks.  In fact this plugin even
ignores the "SMART overall-health self-assessment test result"
focusing only on the wear and lifetime.

Please refer do C<perldoc check_ssdwear> for full docs on hardware,
caveats in the lifetime calculation, hardware support and usage
restrictions.

=head1 REQUIRED PROGRAMS

External programs are required: sudo, lsblk, smartctl.

The program uses sudo to run smartctl, so your nagios/nrpe user needs
sudo for this.

=head1 LIFETIME CALCULATION

This plugin aims to estimate the remaining lifespan of SSDs in terms
of months based on the wear percentage each time it is run. However,
due to the high number of hours it takes for each percentage point of
wear, the estimates will be inaccurate and wary over time.

Because: 1% of wear can be up to many tens of months.  In this case
the wear might not matter because the disk will probably live longer
than the host it serves.  For the disks this was developed with it was
about 8 months pr. percentage point of wear.

As long as the wear left percentage is high the calculation will be
very inaccurate so the will only report "many" months of life left for
wear percentages at or above 90%.

Also, to avoid underwarn this plugin subtracts 1 from the percentage
in the calculation.

If this all feels too unreliavble use the -p and -q options to set
percentage-based thresholds.  Although you cannot disable
the -w and -c checks, you can set them to 0.

=head1 DEVICE SUPPORT

Different SSD disks use different SMART attributes to report wear,
therefore this plugin does not support every SSD.

=head2 Supported devices

Hardware reporting the S.M.A.R.T. attributes shown below is supported.
The attribute number is supplied in paranthesis, but I've seen that
differnet manufacturers use the same attribute name but different
numbers.  This plugin only matches the attribute name.

=over 4

=item Media_Wearout_Indicator (233)

This is supported by (some?) Intel SSDs.  It reports the nominal wear
left on the device in percent.  The drives I've looked at reports a
threshold value of 0.

The raw value of this attribute is always 0.

=item Wear_Leveling_Count (177)

This is supported by (some?) Samsung SSDs.  It reports the nominal
wear left on the device in percent.  The drives I've looked at reports
a threshold value of 5% but superuser.com shows screen dumps where the
threshold is 0.

The raw value for this attribute increases with wear but is useless
for this plugin unless we can determine that the maximum value is, or
how it relates to the percentage - which will vary from device to
device and with disk capacity.

=back

Some other attributes are shown on
https://www.hdsentinel.com/ssd_case_health_decrease_wearout.php but I
hesitate to implement support without a data sheet or other reference
material and a sample output.

=head2 Unsupported devices

The plugin ignores devices that `lsblk -o NAME,MODEL` shows as
"LOGICAL VOLUME".  These might be hardware RAID drives etc.  Hopefuly
you have some hardware specific plugin to monitor the health of these
drives.

If your server has unsupported SSDs the plugin will report a "UNKNOWN"
error and identify the first unsupported device.  If so you will need
to update the plugin to either ignore or support the specific
hardware.  Please provide PR if you decide to support the device.

If you would like to support more devices PRs are welcome.  Please
take the trouble of looking up your devices data sheet to see what the
manufacturer says about how the attribute works and update the
documentation above.

This plugin does not support disks hidden behind RAID
controllers. Some RAID controllers report that the RAID device is
non-rotational and so some effort is spent to ignore these.  Patches
welcome, both for ignoring them and supporting them if there are SSDs
behind there.

This plugin does not support NVME disks.  They have different
reporting format than disks with SSD interface.  Patches welcome.

=head1 BUGS

Probably.

=head2 GPT, AI assistance

I have experimented with ChatGPT(3.5) and GPT4 while writing this
plugin.  After all it was tweeted that it could produce perfectly
working programs in one try.

The good news: GPT is quite good at structuring code.  It also taught
me about the ROTA column for lsblk which made things a lot easier.

Given error messages from python it immediately understoond that I was
using python 2 not python3 (old server running CentOS 7) and provided
corrected code that worked in python 2.

https://github.com/yunal/notes/issues/4

Also see https://github.com/yunal/notes/issues/3 for some quite
impressive keeping track of details and raising the abstraction
stakes.

The bad news: It of course can't test the programs and has trouble
with what regular expressions really do, and which parts of strings
they pull out.

Overall GPT3.5 and GPT4 appears to be a trainee or junior programmer
that writes programs with perfect syntax in both shell, perl and
python.  It makes some rather obvious mistakes with regards to which
columns of output to use and finds it hard to write (more) correct
code when the mistakes are pointed out.

Some of the documentation text was suggested or influenced by
GPT4. GPT4 also provided proff reading.  I was unable to get GPT4 to
write this plugin for me.  I also asked GPT4 to suggest improvements
to the code but the suggestions would either not work or make the code
harder to read.
